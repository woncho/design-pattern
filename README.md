<!-- ABOUT THE DESIGN PATTERN -->
## About The Design Pattern
## Strategy Pattern
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
## Observer Pattern
Define a one-to-manay dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
## Decorator Pattern
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynaimically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
